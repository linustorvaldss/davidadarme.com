Medellín, known as *the city of eternal spring*, is one of those places that instantly wins your heart. I was lucky enough to experience it thanks to a very special friend, [Jayson Salazar](https://www.instagram.com/jdsalaro), who invited me to his home and introduced me to his wonderful family. Their hospitality was genuine, the homemade food delicious, and the company unforgettable. 

The people of Medellín are incredibly warm and kind, and the city itself offers a perfect mix of modernity, culture, and natural beauty. We definitely need to visit Medellín at least once in our lives — right, [@mcveigthojeda](https://www.instagram.com/mcveigthojeda/)? 🐶

### A Day at Finca Las Cordilleras

We spent a beautiful day at **[Finca Las Cordilleras](https://lascordilleras.com/index.html)**, located in [El Retiro, Antioquia](https://turismoantioquia.travel/el-retiro), just an hour’s drive from Medellín. The place is surrounded by nature and peace — the perfect escape from the city.

We did some gardening, listened to Avicii on Jayson's vinyl records, and enjoyed stunning mountain views before sharing a delicious meal together. Simple moments that felt truly special.

### Memories of Medellín

This wasn’t my first time in Medellín — I had also visited last year with my grandmother. Back then, I fell in love with the warmth of its people, the amazing food, and the breathtaking landscapes. This trip only reaffirmed that feeling.

The first day was a little chaotic (as all good adventures start), but it quickly turned into a joyful gathering full of laughter and good energy.

I’m also deeply grateful for the friendships I’ve built through our online study group, [Guayahack](https://guayahack.co). People like Jayson and Mcveigth Ojeda have become a very important part of my life. 🙌

### Gratitude and Goodbye (for now)

Finally, I just want to thank Jayson and his family once again for their kindness and generosity. They made me feel at home from the moment I arrived. I truly hope to return soon to keep exploring this beautiful city and everything it has to offer.
